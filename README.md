RUN
```
$ java -p resources/javafx-lib --add-modules javafx.controls -cp bin/ towerd.GameDriver
```

The build.sh file is a unix script file that will build and run the program

This was run and tested on ubuntu 18.10 with java-11

It is suggested to just use that because the java-8 commands are different and you would have to recompile
